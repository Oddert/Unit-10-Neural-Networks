## Neural Network Library
### This library is based off of a series by The Coding Train (https://github.com/shiffman) (YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos)

This work in progress build for a basic Nueral Network library is intended to be used for the two components within the final system outcome:

- Voice Pattern Matcher
- Voice Analytics suite (to accompany the electroglottograph)

Later it will be likely replaced with a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch and most likely a pre-trained model for the sake of function over experimentation but for now serves as a prototypal build for the above designs.
